    title: 'The Monthly',
    text: 'The Monthly launched in 2005. It is Australia’s foremost magazine on politics and culture. It publishes this country’s leading writers, and every issue drives and reflects the national conversation. At the magazine’s launch, publisher Morry Schwartz said The Monthly would be marked out by its independence. It would be socially and politically progressive; concerned but never wet; open-minded and courageous. More than anything, it would be defined by good writing. “The Monthly will aim to capture the essence of Australia, both as it was and as it is,” Schwartz said. “It will cover the significant political, social and cultural tides … The conception of this magazine was prompted by the fact that nothing like it exists nor really ever existed in Australia.” The Monthly has published key journalism on everything from the Gunns pulp mill in Tasmania to the death in custody of Cameron Doomadgee on Palm Island. As a forum for ideas, it has carried agenda-setting essays from intellectuals such as Galarrwuy Yunupingu and Robert Manne. Kevin Rudd began his push for the prime ministership in its pages and wrote his inside account of the global financial crisis for its cover. The magazine later carried a forensic account of how he undermined the leadership of his predecessor. From its inception, The Monthly has never compromised its editorial standards. It is edited more like a book than a magazine. Its contributor list is a rollcall of Australia’s key writers: Helen Garner, Richard Flanagan, David Marr, Don Watson, Chloe Hooper, Tim Winton, Christos Tsiolkas, Noel Pearson, Anne Manne, Robert Manne, Karen Hitchcock, Anwen Crawford, Anna Goldsworthy and J.M. Coetzee. As Schwartz says: “Without our writers we are nothing.” The Monthly was launched to give writers, commentators and critics the time and space to explore the issues that matter now and will matter in the future, to distil complex arguments and ideas in ways that entertain and inform. Like its sister publications, Quarterly Essay and The Saturday Paper, it values great writing and treats it well. Schwartz once described The Monthly as “a free spirited friend who comes to visit, full of stories, opinion, information, insight and surprise”.',

    title: 'The Saturday Paper',
    text: 'The Saturday Paper is a quality weekly newspaper, dedicated to narrative long-form journalism. Launched in 2014, it offers the biggest names and best writing in news, culture and analysis, with a particular focus on Australia. In its first edition, The Saturday Paper promised to drag news out of the narrows into which it had been forced, to make a virtue of knowledge that was broad and deep. It promised to take on the task of explaining Australia. The Saturday Paper is journalism for people who care, written by people who care. Since its launch, it has carried issue-defining work from Karen Middleton, Rick Morton, Martin McKenzie-Murray and Mike Seccombe. It publishes writers such as Richard Flanagan, Chloe Hooper, Behrouz Boochani, David Marr, Christos Tsiolkas, Kate Holden and Maxine Beneba Clarke. Publisher Morry Schwartz says this is what defines the paper. “Schwartz Media is a writer-based company,” he says. “Our ethic is our writers. Every culture has its own writers, who reflect that culture … A great writer is able to somehow feel the country. A country has to be told what it is. That’s the project.” The Saturday Paper’s commitment is to journalism that makes a difference, journalism that is completely independent, that cares about Australia. It is trusted and sensitive, issue defining and courageous.',

    title: '7am',
    text: "7am is a daily news podcast. It is the big story, the news that defines the moment. It's what you need to know: who's involved, what it means and why it matters. It's news with narrative, every weekday. 7am is questioning and idiosyncratic – memorable, likeable, fresh and trusted. It is an interview-based show, taking the story of the day and finding the voices that tell it best. It is fast paced and tightly edited, intimate and accessible. The roots of 7am are there in other Schwartz Media titles, The Monthly and The Saturday Paper. It has a deep belief in the craft of journalism, in the polish and quality that make good storytelling essential. 7am is like listening to a short story. It takes you in and lets a scene unfold detail by detail. The principles are taken from documentary filmmaking more than from radio. The show is built around narrative, always asking a big question and using a story to answer it.",
